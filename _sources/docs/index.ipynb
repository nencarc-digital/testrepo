    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This section will cover how to create your own book using this template. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will need a GitHub account setup for this process (if not using the nencarc.digital@gmail.com account) which can be done by clicking on this [link](https://github.com/join).\n",
    "\n",
    "You will learn how to\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  install the relevant packages required for github\n",
    "2.  setup a new github repository and github page\n",
    "3.  add/edit/delete content from the book \n",
    "4.  push the content to the github repository and live github page \n",
    "\n",
    "### Packages Needed\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, Git is required to be installed on your system. Depending if you are on a Windows device or MAC OS device, there are different installation methods to use. \n",

    "#### Windows Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "For Windows, the following [link](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.37.3.windows.1/Git-2.37.3-32-bit.exe) will lead you to the installation package. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mac OS Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "For Mac OS, I would recommend the use of Homebrew for the installation, which can be installed via entering the following code into terminal."
